# Tutorial Heaven - GraphQL

### Why?
I used a lot of serializers and different ways to try to ensure I only was getting the information from each call to the API that I wanted. I wondered if there was an easier way to do this, and it seems GraphQL is popular and a well documented solution on the React and Rails side of things.

### Expected difficultues / lingering questions
At this point I am focusing entirely on implementing and getting familiar with the syntax of querying. I am curious how much I will use Redux / what I will use Redux to manage if I implement Apollo on the front end. I am not yet there but that is the biggest question right now.
